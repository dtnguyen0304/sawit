# sawit

SAWIT (small-sized animal wild image dataset) is the first real-world dataset of small-sized animals, collected from camera traps and in realistic conditions. This dataset consists of 34,434 images and is annotated by experts in the field with object-level annotations (bounding boxes) providing 34,820 annotated animals for seven animal categories: frog, lizard, bird, small mammal, medium or big mammal, spider, and scorpion. The dataset encompasses a wide range of challenging scenarios, such as occlusions, blurriness, and instances where animals blend into the dense vegetation. Based on the dataset, we benchmark two prevailing object detection algorithms: Faster RCNN and YOLO, and their variants.
